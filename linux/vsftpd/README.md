# Automated vsftpd Installation and Testing with Ansible

This project automates the installation of the vsftpd FTP server using Ansible playbooks and conducts automated testing to ensure its proper configuration and functionality. It aims to streamline the process of setting up and validating vsftpd servers for use in various environments.

## Overview

The Automated vsftpd Installation and Testing project leverages Ansible to automate the installation and configuration of vsftpd servers. It includes playbooks for setting up vsftpd on multiple target servers and conducting automated tests to verify FTP connectivity, user authentication, and file transfer functionality.

## Features

- **Automated Installation**: Deploy vsftpd servers automatically across multiple hosts using Ansible playbooks.
- **Configuration Management**: Configure vsftpd settings, such as user accounts, directory permissions, and passive mode ports, using Ansible roles.
- **Testing Playbooks**: Execute testing playbooks to validate vsftpd installation and functionality, including user authentication, file transfer, and directory listing.
- **Troubleshooting**: Easily troubleshoot vsftpd setup and configuration issues with detailed error messages and troubleshooting guides.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Ansible installed on your local machine.
- Have SSH access to the target servers where vsftpd will be installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/automated-vsftpd-installation.git
Install any necessary dependencies for Ansible playbooks, such as Python packages or additional Ansible roles.

Update the hosts file with the IP addresses or hostnames of your target servers.
Usage
Modify the Ansible playbook (install-vsftpd.yml) and variables files (vars/main.yml) as needed to customize vsftpd configuration settings.

Run the Ansible playbook to automate vsftpd installation and configuration:
ansible-playbook install-vsftpd.yml -i hosts
Execute the testing playbook (test-vsftpd.yml) to verify vsftpd functionality:
ansible-playbook test-vsftpd.yml -i hosts
Customization
Customize vsftpd configuration settings in the vars/main.yml file to suit your requirements.
Extend the testing playbook (test-vsftpd.yml) to include additional test cases or scenarios.
