## Overview

This repository serves as the central hub for all Cisco NX-OS related projects and configurations. It is designed to organize various Ansible projects that automate tasks for Cisco NX-OS devices, including configuration management, backups, troubleshooting, and more.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several subdirectories, each representing a different aspect of network management and configuration:

- **backup/**: Contains playbooks and configurations for backing up Cisco NX-OS device configurations.
- **basic/**: Includes basic setup, troubleshooting scripts, and common operational tasks for Cisco NX-OS switches.
- **init/**: Scripts and playbooks for initial device setup and dynamic inventory configurations.
- **ntp-project/**: Dedicated project for managing and configuring Network Time Protocol (NTP) on Cisco NX-OS devices.

Each directory contains its own set of Ansible playbooks, inventory files, and variable files specific to the tasks they are designed to perform.

### Common Directory Structure:
- **ansible.conf/ansible.cfg**: Ansible configuration files tailored to the project.
- **group_vars/**: Contains variables that are applied to groups of hosts.
- **host_vars/**: Variables specific to individual hosts.
- **inventory/**: Hosts and dynamic inventory scripts to target specific Cisco NX-OS devices.
- **playbooks/**: Ansible playbooks designed to perform specific tasks.
- **roles/**: Reusable roles for tasks that require multi-step operations.
- **secrets.yml**: Encrypted secrets file containing sensitive information.
